In recent news, the Entomological Society of America has finally rejected the academic use of the ethnic slur 'gypsy' in the common names of two insects, the lepidopteran *Lymantria dispar* and the ant *Aphaenogaster araneoides*, formerly known as the gypsy moth and ant respectively. The term is considered perjorative toward the Romani people, an ethnic minority .

This action closely follows the development of an ESA task force called the Better Names Project, which seeks to correct offensive common names of insects. 

We at the Dwyer Lab, who have worked with *Lymantria dispar* for years, whole-heartedly support this act of respect that is long overdue. Until a new common name is chosen (I vote the color-spot caterpillar, check out the picture below to see why!), we will be using the scientific name both in and out of academic settings.
