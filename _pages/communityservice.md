My key contributions included:

* writing meeting agendas and facilitating meetings

### Graduate Council: Biological Sciences Division Representative
As the BSD Rep on Graduate Council, I was one of 33 elected representatives from the university's 12 graduate schools and divisions. My role is to advocate the needs and passions of members of my division by disseminating important information and voting across a range of topics related to the graduate student experience.

As a representative, I sat on the Health & Wellness Committee, where I worked in a small team to create and implement programming aimed at improving community well-being. Projects I worked on include:
* financial and food security workshops
* distribution of house plants and UV lights to combat seasonal depression
* organizing virtual exercise programs during the COVID-19 pandemic
* small grant review

### Dean's Council: Ecology and Evolution Representative
The Dean's Council is an organization run for and by the BSD by elected representatives within each program. As one of two Ecology and Evolution Reps, I advocated for perspectives within my program to the BSD Administration. Furthermore, I worked to organize and support social programming for studens within the BSD. Some highlights during my appointment include:
* spearheading the establishment of a student-only BSD-wide list serve
* planning virtual student hangouts (with goody bags!) during the COVID-19 pandemic

### Keystone Mentorship Program: Ecology and Evolution Lead
The University of Chicago program I am perhaps the proudest to have been a part of is Keystone Community Initiative. In response student feedback of feelings of isolation and difficulty transitioning into graduate school, I workeded with two other students to design and implement a peer mentoring program from the ground up. This program pairs incoming students with upper-year students and provides a plan of events for them to connect throughout the academic year. 2021 was our inagural year, and the program continues to be highly regarded with 100% first year participation every year since.

### Mental Health Check-In: Lead
Also in response to feelings of isolation among graduate students, I co-developed and co-led a bi-monthly Mental Health Check-In. This hour-long gathering was a safe space for students to share experiences and feelings, seek support, and bond over the communal difficulties of graduate school.
