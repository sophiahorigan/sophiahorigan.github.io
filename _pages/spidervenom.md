Back in 2015, Lewis & Clark College was new to the world of 'big data'. I was one of only two students taking on the optional senior thesis with a huge task ahead of me: figure out how to bring big data analysis to our small liberal arts college.

My thesis work was focused on using genetic data to understand the relationship between species of spiders, and their venom proteins, from the same family as the brown-recluse. Because of recent advances in genetic processing, we could now get huge amounts of genetic information from a single sample. Processing all of that data proved to be too much for our desktop computers.

I spearheaded the use of Amazon Web Services Cloud Computing on our campus, building a pipeline for genetic analysis used in perpetuity by the lab. To support this work, I was awarded two Amazon Web Services Cloud Computing grants.

## Posters

I presented a poster of the scientific results at the International Society of Arachnologists conference at Colorado School of Mines in 2016.

I led an hour-long workshop on the use of AWS for small colleges at the Digital Library Federation Forum in Mikwaukee, WI in 2016. 

### Acknowledgements

This work would not have been possible without the support of my undergraduate advisor, [Dr. Greta Binford](https://college.lclark.edu/live/profiles/22-greta-binford). Thank you also to the library team who first gave me the confidnce to start coding: Jeremy McWilliams, Nick Budak, and Rishi Javia.
