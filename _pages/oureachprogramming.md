## Ecological and Epidemiological Modeling in Madagascar
Ecological and Epidemiological Modeling in Madagascar (E2M2) is a week-long educational program with the goal of creating hands-on learning experiences in statistical and mathematical modeling for Malagasy Masters and PhD students. Featuring a combination of lectures, tutorials, and activities, students gain a breadth of knowledge in the use of models for biological analysis.

E2M2 was created by Dr. Cara Brook in 2018. Find out more about E2M2 [here](https://e2m2.org/).

As the program manager on E2M2 2024, I spent 8 months preparing and updating all aspects of the program including syllabus development, instructor assignments and lecture review, student application solicitation and review, lodging and travel logistics, and all aspects of budgeting and payments. During the program itself I was the point person making sure everything went smoothly - from providing technical support to students to rearranging an entire day's schedule when one of Madagascar's regular power outages hit. 

## Coding for Conservation
Coding for Conservation (C4C) is a year-long mentorship program in R-based data analysis and communication for Malagasy students with ongoing research projectts in ecology, conservation, biodiversity science, and related fields.

As the program manager for C4C 2024-2025, I have solicited and review mentor and mentee applications, selected mentor-mentee pairs, and hosted regular virtual check in meetings to provide support and evaluate progress. 

C4C was created by Dr. Cara Brook in 2021. Find out more about C4C [here](https://coding4conservation.org/).
