## Research Topics

{% include feature_row %}

I am a computational ecologist with a passion for asking questions at the intersection of theory and empiricism. The common threat among my work has been seeking to develop computational methods for analyzing large datasets, previously framed in evolution and currently in ecology.

I am interested in pathogens as drivers of animal population dynamics, and the role that changing weather plays. This includes insect outbreaks, 

I am also interested in optimizing experimental data, particularly how we can figure out the best dataset to answer a question and the best experiment to get that dataset, as well as the algorithm best suited to pull signal from that data.
