## Overview

Awarded the University of Chicago Global Health Summer Fellowship in 2022, I took to Madagascar for two months to set up a new field work program using gps telemetry to explore bat movement. Understanding how bats use the landscape is crucial in order to estimate zoonotoc risk; home range analysis allows you to identify interfaces for human-bat interactions. 

The field mission went exactly how field missions tend to go - some success, some failure, lots of learning and lots of adventure. Our first gps tag, which we attach to bats with a collar tied with soluable thread, fell off almost immediately. Fortuantely though, we were able to recover and redeploy the tag on another bat, and had a number of additional successful deployments throughout the summer.

Currently, through my own boots-on-the-ground efforts and my remote management of the US/Malagasy field team in Madagascar, we have deployed XX tags across XX locations. The data is still coming in, but we are starting to see some exciting patterns, and look forward to a forthcoming publication!
