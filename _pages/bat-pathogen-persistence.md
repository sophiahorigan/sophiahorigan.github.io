How do pathogens persist in bat populations? Bats display a number of unique traits that may impact transmission including dense roosting aggregations, migratory behavior, and unique immune system dynamics. Understanding the persistence of viruses in bats is of crucial public health concern: bats are known to host some of the most virulent zoonoses including Nipah and Hendra henipaviruses, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, and Rabies and Lyssa filoviruses.

Using previously published data in combination with novel data from ongoing telemetry studies (see [bat movement research](/_pages/bat-movement.md)), I am evaluating the role of metapopulation dynamics on henipa- and filovirus persistence in the endemic Malagasy fruit bat *Eidolon dupreanum*. By generating simulations using a range of candidate transmission models and parameter values, I can explore the conditions under which we see persistence occur.
