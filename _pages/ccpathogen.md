Climate change can impact disease dynamics in myriad ways, but it is particularly evident when host and pathogen growth and transmission are weather dependent. The spongy moth is an invasive capterpillar that defoliates hardwood trees across North America. It's populations exhibit a range of interesting dynamics from boom-bust cycling to complex spatial patterns, driven largely by infection from two competing pathogens: a baculovirus and a fungus. Both are species-specific and environmentally-transmitted, making them particularly sensitive to climate change. Additionally, spongy moth growth and demography is largely temperature dependent.

In order to investigate the impact that climate change will have on this system, I am pairing large-scale ecological field experiments with high-performace computing to build spatially-explicit models of host and pathogen dynamics. 

The findings from this work will be communicated to the National Forest Service and relevant State Departments of Natural Resources to help advise forest management. Forest health is important not only for local flora and fauna, but for humans as well -- as temperatures increase and conditions dry out, forest health may be key to preventing a continued increase in large-scale wildfires.

## Posters

I presented posters of this work at two consecutive Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease conferences: at Emory University in 2022 and at Pennsylvania State University in 2023.
