Bats are known to host a diverse range of viruses, some of which present a public health risk through zoonotic spillover. Part of a larger project aimed at identifying viruses circulating in Malagasy fruit bats, in this work I evalauted the presence of one particular virus family: Astroviridae. Astroviruses infect a broad range of mammalian hosts from sea lions to rats, and are credited with 2-9% of all acute non-bacterial gastrointestinal infections in human children.

We detected evidence of astrovirus infection in all three species of endemic Malagasy fruit bat from multiple locations, suggesting that astroviruses persistently circulate in these bat populations. A closer look at our single full-genome astrovirus from a juvenile *Rousettus madagascarensis* did not suggest zoonotic capabilities, but given frequent human-bat contact in Madagascar and the propensity for astroviruses to recombine and mutate, this virus family maintains public health concern in Madagascar.
