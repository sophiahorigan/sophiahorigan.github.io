The world depends on US corn, but in 2019, extreme weather events prevented farmers from planting crops on an unprescedented 19.4 million acres. The flooding and saturated soil that extreme weather can cause prevents the use of farm equipment and successful seed germination, leading to a loss of product and steep insurance payouts. In this work, we had two main questions. 1: what were the weather and spatial factors that impacted prevented planting? and 2: How would climate change alter the presence and frequency of prevented planting?

To answer these questions, we utilized cutting-edge machine learning techniques that can find patterns and identify trends in large amounts of data. We idenfied rainfall of specific pre-planting months, soil drainage classification, and winter temperatures to most strongly drive the likelihood of prevented planting. Climate change simulations therefore predicts prevented planting to become less frequent as areas become warmer and drier, but also predict increased intensity when preveneted planting events do occur due to extreme weather. 

This work has key implications for US farmers and crop insurance providers, suggesting they should be mindful of planting windows following cold winter and heavy spring rainfall, particularly if groundwater storage levels are high.
