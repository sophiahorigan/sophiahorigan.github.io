A love for the outdoors as a result of growing up in gorgeous Southern California led me to pursue Biology as an undergraduate at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. I remember thinking, people get paid to be outside and engage with nature?! Through undergrad I developed a strong foundation in ecology, but it wasn't until I took a disease ecology course in my senior year that I found my passion. Disease ecology combined everything I found interesting, bridging scales from within-host dynamics to global pandemics.

I decided to take on a PhD studying infectious disease dynamics at the University of Chicago in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. Over the past five years I've honed my skills in mathematical and statistical modeling of infectious diseases in systems ranging from insects to bats, taking me from Michigan to Madagascar. 

During my time in Madagascar I witnessed the reality of the intersection of poverty and disease, and I became more and more interested in public and global health. 

Now, as I approach the end of my PhD, my life's goal has become clear to me: use my skillset to reduce the global disease burden. I am particularly interested in working to support the internsection of science and public health implementation in low- and middle- income countries, and hope to be able to travel for my job, working in cross-cultural and multi-lingual environments. 

All in all, I have had an incredibly fortunate life, and am ready and excited to work hard to improve the lives of others.
