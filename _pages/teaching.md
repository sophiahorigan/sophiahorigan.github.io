I love to teach, and have sought out opportunities to practice and expand my educational skillset.

### Madagascar Educational Programming



### Environmental Data Science Bootcamps
As a part of my role as a trainee in the NSF Data Science for Energy and Environmental Research Traineeship Program I assisted in teaching an annual bootcamp aimed at giving new and continuing gradaute students a jumptstart into the practical skills needed for conducting research. I led and taught the program section 'Computing for Research'. This course, taught in Python, gave students with prior programming experience a chance to dive more deeply into advanced computational methods, including data exploration and visualization, using the computing cluster, version control software, and working with geodata formats.

I was in charge of developing the curriculum and teaching sessions on computing cluster use and version control software. To enocurage student participation and retention, I developed and led 'live-coding' sessions featuring frequent challenge activities for students to do in small groups. Additionally, I managed a team of teaching assistants throughout the course.

### Teaching Assitant Roles
For my teaching assitant requirement as a PhD student at the University of Chicago, I chose to TA two very different courses: graduate-level Theoretical Ecology, and undergraduate-level non-major The Public and Private Lives of Insects, giving me a wide range of experience in teaching styles and communication of complex ieas. In both courses I graded assignments and held regular office hours. In The Public and Private Lives of Insects, I taught two hour-long lectures of my choosing: one focused on Forensic Entomology, the other an overview of my research into the role of climate change on an insect pathogen system (see Research).
