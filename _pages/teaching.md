I love to teach, and have sought out opportunities to practice and expand my educational skillset.

### Madagascar Educational Programming
As an instructor at Ecological and Epidemiological Modeling in Madagascar (see Madagascar Outreach tab) in both 2022 and 2024, I have taught lectures, tutorials, and activities focused on the use of mathematical models in ecology and epidemiology.

As a mentor in Coding for Conservation (see Madagascar Outreach tab) from 2023-2024, I both led an hour-long virtual lecture and tutorial on basic statistics for the entire group, and regularly met with and supported my mentee on their work.

Both of these experiences have given me strong cross-cultural communcation skills, and are the highlights of my teaching experiences.

### Environmental Data Science Bootcamps
As a part of my role as a trainee in the NSF Data Science for Energy and Environmental Research Traineeship Program I assisted in teaching an annual bootcamp aimed at giving new and continuing gradaute students a jumptstart into the practical skills needed for conducting research. I led and taught the program section 'Computing for Research'. This course, taught in Python, gave students with prior programming experience a chance to dive more deeply into advanced computational methods, including data exploration and visualization, using the computing cluster, version control software, and working with geodata formats.

I was in charge of developing the curriculum and teaching sessions on computing cluster use and version control software. To enocurage student participation and retention, I developed and led 'live-coding' sessions featuring frequent challenge activities for students to do in small groups. Additionally, I managed a team of teaching assistants throughout the course.

### Teaching Assitant Roles
For my teaching assitant requirement as a PhD student at the University of Chicago, I chose to TA two very different courses: graduate-level Theoretical Ecology, and undergraduate-level non-major The Public and Private Lives of Insects, giving me a wide range of experience in teaching styles and communication of complex ieas. In both courses I graded assignments and held regular office hours. In The Public and Private Lives of Insects, I taught two hour-long lectures of my choosing: one focused on Forensic Entomology, the other an overview of my research into the role of climate change on an insect pathogen system (see the Research tab).
