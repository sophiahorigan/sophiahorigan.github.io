I was recently awarded internal funding from The University of Chicago to support an internship with PIVOT, a Madagascar-based model system using science to save lives, strengthen healthcare delivery, and change the world. I first connected with PIVOT while enacting educational programming in Madagascar (see 'E2M2 in the Madagascar Outreach tab'), and became incredibly inspired by their mission and work. This internship with PIVOT has given me practical exprience working with non-profit organizations, and expanded my research into the realm of public and global health. 

My internship project is working to understand the drivers of zero-dose vaccination status (no vaccines) among children in PIVOT's catchement area, Ifanadiana district, Madagascar. Using statistical modeling techiques, we are analyzing multi-year cohort data to identify correlates of vaccination status among households. The reuslts from this work will be communicted both within PIVOT to inform intervention programming, and to the Ministry of Health. I am very excited to be gaining insight into the role of scienctists in non-profits, and how their work supports impelmentation action to improve community health across organizational scales.
